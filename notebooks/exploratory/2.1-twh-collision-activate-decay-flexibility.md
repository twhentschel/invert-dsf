# Flexibility of `collision_activate_decay` collision rate model

In this notebook, we examine the flexibility of the `collision_activate_decay` model in `src.inference.collision_models` by fitting it directly to examples of known collision rate theories explored in the paper [_Improving dynamic collision frequencies: Impacts on dynamic structure factors and stopping powers in warm dense matter_](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0143738). We are particular interested in the expressiveness of our model when the height of the first Drude function is set to zero (see docstring of `collision_activate_decay` for details), effectively reducing the number of parameters we will have to fit. In this case, `collision_activate_decay` will consist of a Lorentzian-type function with a variable height, decay rate, and its width fixed by its height, modulated by a sigmoid-type logistic function with adjustable center and activation gradient parameters.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.optimize import curve_fit

from src.inference import collision_models as models
```

# Read in data for the collision rate theories we want to directly fit to

The data file includes the indepedent variable as the first column and then pairs of adjacent columns that correspond to the real and imaginary parts of the collision rate theories for the material considered (which material is not important). The last column is the density of states of the material and is not needed here.

```python
datafile = "../../data/external/Al-1 _vwf.txt"

# last column of data is not needed for this
data = np.loadtxt(datafile, skiprows=9, unpack=True)[:-1]
print(f"shape of data = {data.shape}")
```

# Plot the results

The solid color lines are for the original data while the matching-colored dashed lines are for the model with optimized parameters.

## All the parameters

```python
# save the optimized parameters for inspection
optparams = []
count = 1
# plot the real part only and our fitted model first
for colldata in data[1::2]:
    # fit the model to the data
    # sigma is the data so we consider the relativer residual in the fit: (ydata - model) / ydata
    popt, _ = curve_fit(models.collision_activate_decay, data[0], colldata, p0=(1,1,1,1,1), sigma=colldata, bounds=(0, np.inf))
    optparams.append(popt)
    # plot the data
    p = plt.loglog(data[0], colldata, label=f"{count}")
    # plot the model with optimized parameters
    plt.plot(data[0], models.collision_activate_decay(data[0], *popt), color=p[-1].get_color(), ls="--")
    count += 1

plt.ylim(1e-3)
plt.legend()

print(np.asarray(optparams))
```

## Four parameters (setting the first parameter corresponding to height of the Drude function to 0)

Define our new 4-parameter model

```python
def collisionmodel(x, *params):
    # set first parameter to 0 before returning the function
    return models.collision_activate_decay(x, 0, *params)
```

```python
# save the optimized parameters for inspection
optparams = []
# plot the real part only and our fitted model first
count = 1
for colldata in data[1::2]:
    # fit the model to the data
    # sigma is the data so we consider the relativer residual in the fit: (ydata - model) / ydata
    popt, _ = curve_fit(collisionmodel, data[0], colldata, p0=(1,1,1,1), sigma=colldata, bounds=(0, np.inf))
    optparams.append(popt)
    # plot the data
    p = plt.loglog(data[0], colldata, label=f"{count}")
    # plot the model with optimized parameters
    plt.plot(data[0], collisionmodel(data[0], *popt), color=p[-1].get_color(), ls="--")
    count += 1

plt.ylim(1e-3)
plt.legend()

print(np.asarray(optparams))
```

The fit to the simplest curve in the plots above (blue) should be possible without the logistic function. By setting the gradient parameter (last parameter in our model, with a keyword `logistic_gradient`) to 0, the logistic function becomes constant with a value of 1/2. Let us see how our model will fit to this simple data when we fix the parameters for the logistic function.

```python
def simplemodel(x, height, power):
    return models.collision_activate_decay(x, 0, height, power, 0, 0)
```

```python
popt, _ = curve_fit(simplemodel, data[0], data[1], sigma=data[1])
p = plt.loglog(data[0], data[1])
# plot the model with optimized parameters
plt.plot(data[0], simplemodel(data[0], *popt), color=p[-1].get_color(), ls="--")

print(popt)
```

Hmmm... If I try to fit this by hand, it's clear that the relationship between the width and height in our Lorentzian model is not quite right to agree with the data here.

```python
p = plt.loglog(data[0], data[1])
# plot the model with optimized parameters
plt.plot(data[0], simplemodel(data[0], 0.7, 1.5), color=p[-1].get_color(), ls="--")
```

```python

```
